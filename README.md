### 🎲 Dice Gaming Project 🎲  

Welcome to the **Dice Gaming Project**! 🎮 This is a **classic beginner-friendly C# project**, perfect for new developers learning about **randomization, conditional logic, and game mechanics**.  

This game simulates rolling **three dice**, applying **bonus points** for doubles and triples, and determining a **winning outcome** based on the final score.  

I originally practiced **C# fundamentals** during my **studies at Lexicon**, but I developed this project **entirely on my own** as an independent challenge.
